# Overview

This software communicates with Google Firebase to store individual DND characters and their stats, level, and health.

I wrote this software becasuse I wanted a way to easily store my DND characters so that I would't run the risk of losing them on my computer. I will be able to access them anywhere.

# Cloud Database

Google Firebase

The original table is called characters, with the next section being the characters names, followed by their information.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code, Google Firebase, and a few peers to create some test characters.

I used the Firebase and Firestore libraries to include the connection to the cloud database and to give me the ability to alter it while in the program.
